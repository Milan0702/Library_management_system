# Library Management System
I have created a Admin side library management portal such that a
librarian can easily access and manage the library using PYTHON.

A library management system is software designed especially to
manage the functions in a library.
It helps librarians to maintain the database of new books and the
books that are borrowed by members along with their due dates.
This system completely automates all your libraryâ€™s activities
This system design consist of two main divisions admin and
student page
For the admin page functionalities such as add book, search book,
view books are given and for the student page issue , return books
and view student activities features has been included
